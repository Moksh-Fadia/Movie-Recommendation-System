Because it measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space, which is a common way to measure similarity between text embeddings; it ranges from -1 (completely dissimilar) to 1 (identical), with 0 indicating orthogonality (no similarity); it is effective for high-dimensional data like text embeddings because it focuses on the direction of the vectors rather than their magnitude, making it less sensitive to differences in length and more focused on the semantic content captured by the embeddings
