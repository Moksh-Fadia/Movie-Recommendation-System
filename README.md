## How It Works

User enters a movie name in the search box.
The system encodes the movie’s combined metadata (overview, genre, cast) using the SentenceTransformer model.
It calculates cosine similarity between movies to find the most semantically similar ones.
Results and recent searches are rendered dynamically via Flask and Jinja templates.

## 🗂️ Database

id (auto-increment primary key)
title (searched movie name)
timestamp (search time)
